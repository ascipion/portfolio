<h2>Endangerment</h2>
<p>Gorillas are considered critically endangered.  Here are some facts about each species' population and reasons for endangerment.</p>
</header>

		<header><h3>Western Lowland Gorilla</h3></header>
		<p>The current population is around 100,000, although this is just an estimate because they inhabit some of the densest and most remote rainforests in Africa.  Causes for decline:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hunting and trade - This is considered their main threat.  In North East Congo, around 5% of Western lowland gorillas are killed by hunters each year.  They are sought after for bushmeat, pets, and their body parts for medicine and magical charms.  Although there are laws to prohibit this, the wildlife legal system is very corrupt there.</li>
			<li>Habitat loss and degradation - The exportation of timber from Central Africa to Europe and Asia has destroyed vast areas of the rainforest where Western Lowland Gorillas live.  The expansion of agriculture, i.e., growth in oil palm plantations, also poses a threat.</li>
			<li>Disease - The Ebola hemorrhagic fever has greatly impacted the Western Lowland Gorilla popoulation, to the tune of about 1/3 of their population.  There is evidence that the virus may still exist there.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div tabindex="0" class ="endangerment3">
		<header><h3>Eastern Lowland Gorilla</h3></header>
		<p>The current population is under 4,000.  In the mid-1990's it was around 17,000.  Causes for decline:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Habitat loss and degradation - There is little protection in the Eastern Lowland Gorilla's range.  The Kahuzi-Biega National Park is under threat from poachers and encroachment.  Coltan, an alloy for mobile phones, is being mined here and forests are being cleared because of this.</li>
			<li>Conflict and instability - There is civil conflict and political instability in the Congo, leading to negligence when it comes to the Congolese National Parks.</li>
			<li>Hunting and trade - This may now be more of a threat to Eastern Lowland Gorillas than habitat loss and degradation.  The number killed each year is unkown, but they are killed mainly for bushmeat.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div tabindex="0" class = "endangerment3">
		<header><h3>Cross River Gorilla</h3></header>
		<p>The current population is around 250-300, as they are restricted to a highland forest on the border of Cameroon and Nigeria due to human hunting pressure.  Causes for decline:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Habitat loss - Cross River gorillas live in unprotected forests and their habitat might be lost due to logging, as people clear land for agriculture and cattle grazing.</li>
			<li>Hunting - As forests are opened up by timber companies, hunters move in.</li>
			<li>Loss of genetic diversity - The small population can face loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding.  Potential gorilla habitats can provide conenctivity between subpopulations but these areas are not safe for gorillas to use.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div tabindex="0" class = "endangerment3">
		<header><h3>Mountain Gorilla</h3></header>
		<p>The current population is approximately 1,004, which has actually increased from 620 in 1989.  Main threats:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Habitat loss - Rwandan refugees in the early 1990's fled to camps near the Virunga National Park and led to firewood harvesting as well as poaching.  Illegal settlers in the Virunga National Park in the Congo cleared tracts to create agricultural and pastoral land.</li>
			<li>Oil & gas exploration- European oil and gas exploration consessions in the Virunga can negatively affect their security.</li>
			<li>War & instability - Continued civil unrest and armed militias makes survey and conservation work difficult in the Congo's protected areas, which are now in rebel-held territory.</li>
			<li>Disease - With more people moving into the habitat for Mountain Gorillas, along with tourists, they are becoming exposed to a variety of human ailments.</li>
